                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    NCR Voyix is a global leader in digital commerce, revolutionizing retail, restaurants, and financial institutions with innovative solutions. 
                    With a rich legacy spanning nearly 140 years, NCR Voyix is committed to simplifying customer experiences and driving growth for clients worldwide. 
                    There are different teams which are working on different projects. I was the part of Wintermute team. Sometimes, we had to coordinate with offshore teams, which are sitting in India. The most difficult part in coordination was the difference in time zones. 
                    Therefore, sometimes we had to work late till midnight as well.
                    During my co-op term, some changes occured at NCR Voyix. As a result our team was switched to a different project. I was able to get adjusted to the sudden changes with the help of team members. My team was very supportive and helpful. 
                    Everyone was determined to complete the task on time with utmost precision.

                                Due to changes made in the company, our team was switched from a project to a different one. I just got familiar with the first one and suddenly I had to get familiarize with the second project.
                                Everyone in my team, including senior developers were new to this project, so there was a lack of knowledge. Everyone, including me, had to communicate with each other a lot and many times we
                                had to interact with offshore teams, which are present in completely different timezones. But consistant efforts helped us deliever the goals for each sprint.

                        <p>
                            It was a wonderful experience to work at NCR Voyix. There's a lot that I gained while working. I got the chance to work with tools and technologies, which I never worked with before. 
                            Before joining, I went through the job description, I found that there were a lot of opportunities to learn about the development of softwares. The most attracting aspect was that the position offers the opportunity to work with a wide range of tools.
                            My tasks include a range of items from developemnt to testing, whether its backend or frontend. Due to helpful nature of my seniors
                            , I was able to achieve each and every goal. I think this co-op term gave me the most experience in technical aspects of development, which will help me achieve my future goals.
