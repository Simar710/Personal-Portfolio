            <p>
                I am a detail-oriented AWS Certified Solution Arcitect Associate & Software Engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and automation. From a young age, I have demonstrated a passion for problem-solving and a drive for continuous learning. My journey began with leadership and teamwork experiences, which were further enriched through playing soccer at the national level in India until a ligament injury shifted my focus to academics. Despite this setback, I successfully cracked some of Indiaâ€™s toughest entrance exams with just a year of preparation and discovered my passion for software development during the 2020 quarantine, where I began learning Java.

            <p>
                My academic journey brought me to the University of Guelph, where I pursued Software Engineering and gained hands-on experience through 6 impactful co-ops, earning "Outstanding" evaluations in several. These internships allowed me to enhance application performance, implement innovative solutions like microservices architectures and CI/CD pipelines, and collaborate within cross-functional teams. Additionally, my roles as a Teaching Assistant, Grader, and in various part-time positions honed my technical expertise and interpersonal skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about growing and leveraging my experience and knowledge gained so far to find solutions for challenging problems and enhance user/customer experiences. I thrive on challenges and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my expertise. With a proven track record of leadership, adaptability, and excellence, I am excited to contribute to the ever-evolving field of software development and collaborate on transformative projects.
            </p>
